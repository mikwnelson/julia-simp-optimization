  abstract = {The Conjugate Gradient Method is the most prominent iterative method for solving sparse systems of linear equations.
Unfortunately, many textbook treatments of the topic are written with neither illustrations nor intuition, and their
victims can be found to this day babbling senselessly in the corners of dusty libraries. For this reason, a deep,
geometric understanding of the method has been reserved for the elite brilliant few who have painstakingly decoded
the mumblings of their forebears. Nevertheless, the Conjugate Gradient Method is a composite of simple, elegant ideas
that almost anyone can understand. Of course, a reader as intelligent as yourself will learn them almost effortlessly.
The idea of quadratic forms is introduced and used to derive the methods of Steepest Descent, Conjugate Directions,
and Conjugate Gradients. Eigenvectors are explained and used to examine the convergence of the Jacobi Method,
Steepest Descent, and ConjugateGradients. Other topics include preconditioningand the nonlinear ConjugateGradient
Method. I have taken pains to make this article easy to read. Sixty-six illustrations are provided. Dense prose is
avoided. Concepts are explained in several different ways. Most equations are coupled with an intuitive interpretation.},
